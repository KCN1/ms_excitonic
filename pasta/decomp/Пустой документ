Most interest-
ingly, the splittings follow a linear relationship when plotted as
a function of cos[ ␲ 兾(n ⫹ 1)], with n the number of oligomers in
the stack, see Fig. 6. Such a linear evolution is the one expected
in the framework of tight-binding models, for which the total
bandwidth for a one-dimensional stack is expressed as 4t ⫻
cos[ ␲ 兾(n ⫹ 1)]. The excellent linear match indicates that the
splittings calculated for large clusters at the INDO level are
dominated by interactions between adjacent neighbors. Thus, in
this context, the total valence and conduction bandwidths of an
infinite one-dimensional stack can be estimated from a simple
dimer calculation (4t being then simply twice the total dimer
splitting).
